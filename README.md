# Itunes-Search


Exercise:

Design and build an iOS application that fetches and displays artist data from the following iTunes url:
https://itunes.apple.com/search?term={any ArtistName}

Functionality:

When the iOS app is launched, it should display a field to enter text and a button (can be placed anywhere on the screen) named “Search Artist”. 
When an artist name is entered in the field and the button is tapped, a spinner should be shown until the data is downloaded. (use the above url to download artist data)
 Once the data is available, the spinner should be dismissed, and a scrollable list of the artist’s tracks should be shown. Each item in the list should contain the following data:

artistName

trackName

TrackPrice

releaseDate

primaryGenreName

 Please use the programming that language that you’re most familiar and comfortable with.

Testing: Including unit tests (preferably using TDD) is highly recommended as part of the coding exercise
